# This is where all Choregraphe code should exist for the Airport application

The `main` behaviour is the starting point of the application and where all other behaviours should be integrated.

There should only be one project (.pml) and it is already here - `Airport.pml`

Create you own behaviours in this directory.

A behaviour consists of:
- a folder which will be the name of the behaviour
- `behaviour.xar` that lives inside the behaviour folder

You can use the *Run Behaviour* behaviour to run any behaviour in the project.
